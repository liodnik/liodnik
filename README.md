### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
There are a couple of my projects I'm working on today:

![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1481354?s=12) [Tajemny Santa (Secret Santa)](https://github.com/liodnik/tajemny_santa) -- Every Christmas my friends and I meet and exchange gifts. A service should help us with this. In theory it should randomly distributes who gives what to whom and sends out mailings [in progress][in very beginning]

![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1481354?s=12) [Exercism - Elixir](https://github.com/liodnik/exercism-tasks-elixir) -- I love to do awesome super interesting tasks in exercism.org and I store solutions here.
